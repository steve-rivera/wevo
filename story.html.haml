          %h3.mbs.color-white How WEVO Was Born
          %p.mbs
            We found a common pattern - Product teams would talk to a few customers, understand their problems, and build products for those few customers. They did not validate if they were solving their target market's more pressing problems, and if they were introducing the right set of features to solve these problems. We helped some of our clients conduct research with a broader segment of their target market, prove/disprove their hypothesis, and really,deeply understand what matters to their target market.

          %p
            Our vision is a world in which product managers can quickly evaluate their ideas, new features and experiences, relying on customer feedback they can trust.  That is why we developed a platform that for the first time enables companies to have a reliable and rapid feedback mechanism with the target customers, at their finger tips.
